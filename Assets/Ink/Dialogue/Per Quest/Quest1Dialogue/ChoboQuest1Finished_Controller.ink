So, I see you need some more information on how to control your little metal joints and hinges. Worry not, I am here to help!
To move around, you use the left thumbstick.
If you want to go a little faster hold down the right trigger to sprint.
Jumping is done by pressing the A-button.
To interact use the B-button and use the Y-button to pick up objects as displayed on screen.
I think that is it for the controls. Good luck out there!
