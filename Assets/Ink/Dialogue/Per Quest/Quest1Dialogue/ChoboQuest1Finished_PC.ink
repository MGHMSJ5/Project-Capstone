So, I see you need some more information on how to control your little metal joints and hinges. Worry not, I am here to help!
To move around, you use the WASD-keys.
If you want to go a little faster hold down the SHIFT-key to sprint.
Jumping is done by pressing the Spacebar.
To interact use the E-key and use the F-key to pick up objects as displayed on screen.
I think that is it for the controls. Good luck out there!
